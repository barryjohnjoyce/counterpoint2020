# CounterPoint 2020 - Prototype Working Website

## Overview

### What is this app for?

Counterpoint 2020 is a working prototype website to enable moderated political discussion.

### What does it do?

Users are required to register on the site and a small membership fee is required to discourage time-wasters and trolls
and encourage serious debate through a blog and discussion forum.

### Design Background

The website has been designed using a free basic Bootstrap website theme. The design and colouring has been deliberately
kept simple and uncluttered,with a background of very light gray with some black and red elements.

## Features

A member registers to become part of the site community. Membership is activated and maintained via a small recurring
payment using Stripe. Members can blog articles, opinions and theories about the political situation today, and add images
to their blog post if they so choose. A Forum is provided where members can start new threads under one of four political
categories - Irish, European, U.S. and World Politics. Other members can contribute to the thread with the use of Disqus.
An option is also available for the thread owner to include a poll with their initial thread. Non-members can view blogs
and threads but are not authorised to post a new blog or a new thread. A Contacts form and an About page are provided
with links to social media to allow members and non-members to communicate with the moderators.
